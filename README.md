### 📌 Features of the Analysis

* Multi-year analysis of **foreign visitor trends** by district and month
* Identified **top-performing**, **emerging**, and **declining districts**
* SQL logic used: **aggregations**, **joins**, **window functions**, **ranking**
* Excel used for **data cleaning and year-wise combination**

---

### 🧠 Tools Used

* **Excel** – Data Cleaning, Merging District-Level Data
* **SQL** – Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions, CASE WHEN
